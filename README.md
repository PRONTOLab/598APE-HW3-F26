# CS598APE HW3

This repository contains code for homework 3 of CS598APE. It is relatively
simple in comparison to HW1 and HW2 to ensure you have enough time to work on
the course project. 

`sandpile.c` contains the implementation of finding the identity element of a 2D
abelian sandpile.

*Identity sandpile on a 1001x1001 pacman grid*


To compile the program, run:

```bash
make all
```

To clean existing build artifacts, run:

```bash
make clean
```

Usage (after compiling):

```bash
./sandpile.exe <N> 
```

where `N` is the grid size

Consider speeding up the generation of this 1001x1001 identity sandpile (which
takes approximately ~3m 40s on my local laptop under the default setup)

```bash
./sandpile.exe 1001
```

For an optional, ungraded challenge, see how large a sandpile you can compute
on the course VMs and report the grid size and runtime. There is no prescribed
upper limit on `N` for this challenge.
